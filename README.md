# Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze Netflix data using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. The dataset used in this project contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix.

## Overview

The dataset includes various attributes such as show ID, type (Movie/TV Show), title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, listed in (genres), and description. Using this dataset, we perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the Netflix content catalog.

## Requirements
